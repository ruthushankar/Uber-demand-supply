# Uber-demand-supply
Many a time while commuting with Uber we face cancellations due to various reasons.In this visualization,we narrow down the issues to Ride cancellations and unavailability of cars leading to potential revenue loss.

Many a time while travelling with Uber to or from the Airport we won’t be able to book.Why?
The reasons can be plenty for example:
1)Over bookings as it might lead to a jam in the server.
2)Network issue on the driver’s end or on the passenger’s end
3)Scarcity in the number of uber cars
Let’s dive into the problem to understand the root cause of the problem

# 6 main attributes of our dataset
Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available

# Conclusions and Suggestions
Uber should hire more number of cars since the number of times rides aren’t available are almost same as the number of times Uber rides are  completed.
In the City,out of 1000+ Uber requests made from 5am-10am ,800+ rides were Cancelled.
In the Airport, out of 1400+ requests made 1300+ indicated Unavailability of cars.
There is more unavailability of cars at the airport compared to when  City is the pickup point. Hence,Uber should make cabs more accessible at the airport especially during peak hours(4pm-12am).
Lastly, Uber must make more cabs available in the city during the hours 5 am to 10 am since there are maximum number of Cancellations during that time.
Uber can also take stricter measures whenever a Cancellation is done from the driver’s end
